THINGS TO FIX
[] Mediawiki isnt returning sections that are templated in some instances, i will have to find a way to either fix that or otherwise change the parsing to read the raw html instead.

THINGS TO DO
[] Check to see if the item is just available from a vendor, if so, store the vendor price and the MB price, sometimes items are available from a vendor, but only after doing multiple steps in a quest chain
