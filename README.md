# gogils

Gogils is a tool for ffxiv to assist in crafting cost 
optimiztion. Instead of having to look up the price of each
individual ingredient, if it is npc purchaseable, and which
world has it cheapest on the marketboard, just look it all
up at once!

Gogils is currently very much under development, but future 
versions will include the ability to do:

[x] recursive recipe searches on ingredients
[ ] display both vendor and MB prices for items
[ ] display current universalis prices across worlds
[ ] show historic price data 

Anything outside of this is likely also outside the scope of the
tool as it is currently indended to be used.
